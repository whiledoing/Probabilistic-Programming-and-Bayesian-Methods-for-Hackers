You are starting to believe that there may be no bugs in this code...\n",

A Bayesian can rarely be certain about a result, but he or she can be very confident. Just like in the example above, we can never be 100% sure that our code is bug-free unless we test it on every possible problem; something rarely possible in practice. Instead, we can test it on a large number of problems, and if it succeeds we can feel more *confident* about our code, but still not certain.  Bayesian inference works identically: we update our beliefs about an outcome; rarely can we be absolutely sure unless we rule out all other alternatives. "

        "### The Bayesian state of mind\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian inference differs from more traditional statistical inference by preserving *uncertainty*. At first, this sounds like a bad statistical technique. Isn't statistics all about deriving *certainty* from randomness? To reconcile this, we need to start thinking like Bayesians. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Bayesian world-view interprets probability as measure of *believability in an event*, that is, how confident we are in an event occurring. In fact, we will see in a moment that this is the natural interpretation of probability. \n",
        "\n",
        "For this to be clearer, we consider an alternative interpretation of probability: *Frequentist*, known as the more *classical* version of statistics, assume that probability is the long-run frequency of events (hence the bestowed title). For example, the *probability of plane accidents* under a frequentist philosophy is interpreted as the *long-term frequency of plane accidents*. This makes logical sense for many probabilities of events, but becomes more difficult to understand when events have no long-term frequency of occurrences. Consider: we often assign probabilities to outcomes of presidential elections, but the election itself only happens once! Frequentists get around this by invoking alternative realities and saying across all these realities, the frequency of occurrences defines the probability. \n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesians, on the other hand, have a more intuitive approach. Bayesians interpret a probability as measure of *belief*, or confidence, of an event occurring. Simply, a probability is a summary of an opinion. An individual who assigns a belief of 0 to an event has no confidence that the event will occur; conversely, assigning a belief of 1 implies that the individual is absolutely certain of an event occurring. Beliefs between 0 and 1 allow for weightings of other outcomes. This definition agrees with the probability of a plane accident example, for having observed the frequency of plane accidents, an individual's belief should be equal to that frequency, excluding any outside information. Similarly, under this definition of probability being equal to beliefs, it is meaningful to speak about probabilities (beliefs) of presidential election outcomes: how confident are you candidate *A* will win?\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice in the paragraph above, I assigned the belief (probability) measure to an *individual*, not to Nature. This is very interesting, as this definition leaves room for conflicting beliefs between individuals. Again, this is appropriate for what naturally occurs: different individuals have different beliefs of events occurring, because they possess different *information* about the world. The existence of different beliefs does not imply that anyone is wrong. Consider the following examples demonstrating the relationship between individual beliefs and probabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "- I flip a coin, and we both guess the result. We would both agree, assuming the coin is fair, that the probability of Heads is 1/2. Assume, then, that I peek at the coin. Now I know for certain what the result is: I assign probability 1.0 to either Heads or Tails (whichever it is). Now what is *your* belief that the coin is Heads? My knowledge of the outcome has not changed the coin's results. Thus we assign different probabilities to the result. \n",
        "\n",
        "-  Your code either has a bug in it or not, but we do not know for certain which is true, though we have a belief about the presence or absence of a bug.  \n",
        "\n",
        "-  A medical patient is exhibiting symptoms $x$, $y$ and $z$. There are a number of diseases that could be causing all of them, but only a single disease is present. A doctor has beliefs about which disease, but a second doctor may have slightly different beliefs. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This philosophy of treating beliefs as probability is natural to humans. We employ it constantly as we interact with the world and only see partial truths, but gather evidence to form beliefs. Alternatively, you have to be *trained* to think like a frequentist. \n",
        "\n",
        "To align ourselves with traditional probability notation, we denote our belief about event $A$ as $P(A)$. We call this quantity the *prior probability*.\n",
        "\n",
        "John Maynard Keynes, a great economist and thinker, said \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\" This quote reflects the way a Bayesian updates his or her beliefs after seeing evidence. Even &mdash; especially &mdash; if the evidence is counter to what was initially believed, the evidence cannot be ignored. We denote our updated belief as $P(A |X )$, interpreted as the probability of $A$ given the evidence $X$. We call the updated belief the *posterior probability* so as to contrast it with the prior probability. For example, consider the posterior probabilities (read: posterior beliefs) of the above examples, after observing some evidence $X$:\n",
        "\n",
        "1\\. $P(A): \\;\\;$ the coin has a 50 percent chance of being Heads. $P(A | X):\\;\\;$ You look at the coin, observe a Heads has landed, denote this information $X$, and trivially assign probability 1.0 to Heads and 0.0 to Tails.\n",
        "\n",
        "2\\.   $P(A): \\;\\;$  This big, complex code likely has a bug in it. $P(A | X): \\;\\;$ The code passed all $X$ tests; there still might be a bug, but its presence is less likely now.\n",
        "\n",
        "3\\.  $P(A):\\;\\;$ The patient could have any number of diseases. $P(A | X):\\;\\;$ Performing a blood test generated evidence $X$, ruling out some of the possible diseases from consideration.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It's clear that in each example we did not completely discard the prior belief after seeing new evidence $X$, but we *re-weighted the prior* to incorporate the new evidence (i.e. we put more weight, or confidence, on some beliefs versus others). \n",
        "\n",
        "By introducing prior uncertainty about events, we are already admitting that any guess we make is potentially very wrong. After observing data, evidence, or other information, we update our beliefs, and our guess becomes *less wrong*. This is the alternative side of the prediction coin, where typically we try to be *more right*. \n"

Technically this parameter in the Bayesian function is optional, but we will see excluding it has its own consequences. \n",

For example, if your prior belief is something ridiculous, like \"I expect the sun to explode today\", and each day you are proved wrong, you would hope that any inference would correct you, or at least align your beliefs better. Bayesian inference will correct this belief.\n",

        "\n",
        "Denote $N$ as the number of instances of evidence we possess. As we gather an *infinite* amount of evidence, say as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, our Bayesian results (often) align with frequentist results. Hence for large $N$, statistical inference is more or less objective. On the other hand, for small $N$, inference is much more *unstable*: frequentist estimates have more variance and larger confidence intervals. This is where Bayesian analysis excels. By introducing a prior, and returning probabilities (instead of a scalar estimate), we *preserve the uncertainty* that reflects the instability of statistical inference of a small $N$ dataset. \n",
        "\n",
        "One may think that for large $N$, one can be indifferent between the two techniques since they offer similar inference, and might lean towards the computationally-simpler, frequentist methods.

But once $N$ is \"large enough,\" you can start subdividing the data to learn more (for example, in a public opinion poll, once you have a good estimate for the entire country, you can estimate among men and women, northerners and southerners, different age groups, etc.). $N$ is never enough because if it were \"enough\" you'd already be on to the next problem for which you need more data.\n",

Bayesian methods complement these techniques by solving problems that these approaches cannot, or by illuminating the underlying system with more flexible modeling.\n",

Then associated with $Z$ is a *probability distribution function* that assigns probabilities to the different outcomes $Z$ can take.

One can describe $\\lambda$ as the *intensity* of the Poisson distribution. \n",

As we saw earlier, the *exponential* distribution provides a continuous density function for positive numbers, so it might be a good choice for modeling $\\lambda_i$. But recall that the exponential distribution takes a parameter of its own, so we'll need to include that parameter in our model. Let's call that parameter $\\alpha$.\n",

Our initial guess at $\\alpha$ does not influence the model too strongly, so we have some flexibility in our choice.  A good rule of thumb is to set the exponential parameter equal to the inverse of the average of the count data. Since we're modeling $\\lambda$ using an exponential distribution, we can use the expected value identity shown earlier to get:\n",

We can also see what the plausible values for the parameters are: $\\lambda_1$ is around 18 and $\\lambda_2$ is around 23. The posterior distributions of the two $\\lambda$s are clearly distinct, indicating that it is indeed likely that there was a change in the user's text-message behaviour.\n",

In fact, the posterior distributions are not really of any form that we recognize from the original model. But that's OK! This is one of the benefits of taking a computational point of view. If we had instead done this analysis using mathematical approaches, we would have been stuck with an analytically intractable (and messy) distribution. Our use of a computational approach makes us indifferent to mathematical tractability.\n",

Its posterior distribution looks a little different from the other two because it is a discrete random variable, so it doesn't assign probabilities to intervals. We can see that near day 45, there was a 50% chance that the user's behaviour changed. Had no change occurred, or had the change been gradual over time, the posterior distribution of $\\tau$ would have been more spread out, reflecting that many days were plausible candidates for $\\tau$. By contrast, in the actual results we see that only three or four days make any sense as potential transition points. "

We can speculate what might have caused this: a cheaper text-message rate, a recent weather-to-text subscription, or perhaps a new relationship. (In fact, the 45th day corresponds to Christmas, and I moved away to Toronto the next month, leaving a girlfriend behind.)\n"
